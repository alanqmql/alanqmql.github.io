# Hobbies

Whether it's the lightning-fast badminton court or the cerebral ping pong table, I find joy and challenge in both sports. The rapid dodges and precise smashes of badminton bring me the collision of speed and passion; while the precise spins and intense back-and-forth of ping pong constantly hone my focus and reflexes. In the past, long-distance running and swimming gave me resilience and a clear mindset, but now, intense badminton and dynamic ping pong have become indispensable sources of passion in my life, infusing every swing with boundless energy and enjoyment.

## Badminton

Badminton has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. There’s something about the speed and agility required on the court that really excites me. Whether it’s a casual game with friends or a more serious rally, I love the challenge of the game. The quick reflexes, the soaring shuttlecock, and the thrill of a well-timed smash—badminton has a way of keeping me on my toes and my mind sharp.

## Table Tennis

Table tennis, or ping pong, is another sport that I’m passionate about. The precision and fast-paced nature of the game make every point a mini battle of wits and reflexes. Whether I’m practicing my serves or competing in a friendly match, I appreciate the focus and concentration it demands. Plus, it’s a lot of fun to challenge friends and improve my skills with each rally!

## Past Hobbies

In the past, I spent a lot of time running long distances and swimming. Both activities helped me build endurance and enjoy the sense of achievement that comes with pushing my physical limits. I would often take part in local running events or head to the pool for a refreshing swim. These hobbies also gave me a chance to clear my mind and reflect. Recently, however, my focus has shifted to badminton and table tennis.
