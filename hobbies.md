# Hobbies

This page gives a glimpse into my creative world, which I’ve been diving into more deeply over the past year. Along with my growing interest in crocheting and pixel bead art, I’ve always loved the active enjoyment that badminton and table tennis bring. If you're ever up for a match or just want to chat about rackets and paddles, feel free to drop me a line at houyanqiu2003@163.com!

## Badminton

Badminton has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. There’s something about the speed and agility required on the court that really excites me. Whether it’s a casual game with friends or a more serious rally, I love the challenge of the game. The quick reflexes, the soaring shuttlecock, and the thrill of a well-timed smash—badminton has a way of keeping me on my toes and my mind sharp.

## Table Tennis

Table tennis, or ping pong, is another sport that I’m passionate about. The precision and fast-paced nature of the game make every point a mini battle of wits and reflexes. Whether I’m practicing my serves or competing in a friendly match, I appreciate the focus and concentration it demands. Plus, it’s a lot of fun to challenge friends and improve my skills with each rally!

## Past Hobbies

I used to spend hours hiking through the hills near my hometown, sketching landscapes, and binge-watching documentaries about public health innovations. Recently, though, my time is filled with badminton, table tennis, hooks, and beads.

## My Dream Craft Corner

One day, I’d love to have a cozy little craft nook filled with yarn in every shade and beads of every size—a space where I can create, dream, and maybe even teach others the joy of crafting.
